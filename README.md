A script to help prepare ACM proceedings with page numbers. It is a hack!

Prerequisit:
One or more folders containing the papers named according to ACM guidelines,
e.g. p10-meling.pdf
The ordering of the PDFs will be defined by the page number.

This script is just a quick hack to do three things:

1. Create a latex file 'proceedings.tex' based on the pdf files in
   the folders. This is obtained by running:
     go run main.go -latex > proceedings.tex

   The script does not compile the latex file to generate proceedings.pdf

2. Once you have compiled the 'proceedings.pdf' you can run:
     go run main.go -split > split.sh

   This will create a script that will split the 'proceedings.pdf' file into
   single page PDFs. You need to run 'split.sh' to do this.

3. You can now run:
     go run main.go -unite > unite.sh

   This will create another script that will unite the single page PDFs into
   one PDF per paper again, named according to ACM guidelines.

Dependencies:
- This script is written in Go, so you need to install Go.
- The scripts generated by this script requires some PDF tools that are
  available in the poppler package (see below for link.)

If you are on a Mac, and have homebrew installed, you can use these packages:

% brew install go

% brew install poppler

Otherwise these can be downloaded from here, for other OSes:
